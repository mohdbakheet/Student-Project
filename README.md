# 📦 Repository: Student-Project `sir-covid-fitting`

### 📁 Project Title:

**Modeling and Fitting the SIR Epidemic Model to COVID-19 Case Data**

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository provides a simple and educational implementation of the **SIR compartmental model**, fitted to real or synthetic COVID-19 case data using Python. It is designed as a small student project to demonstrate how mathematical models are used to simulate and interpret epidemic dynamics.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

* Understand the basic structure of the SIR model
* Fit model parameters to real cumulative case data
* Visualize disease spread and estimate the basic reproduction number $R_0$
* Explore intervention effects such as vaccination or isolation

# 🧪 SIR COVID-19 Model Fitting

This project simulates the spread of an epidemic using the SIR model and fits it to actual or synthetic COVID-19 cumulative case data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sir-covid-fitting.git
cd sir-covid-fitting
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the model

```bash
python src/fit_sir_model.py
```

## 📈 Output

The script generates a plot comparing the observed case data and the fitted SIR curve. It also estimates the basic reproduction number $R_0 = \beta/\gamma$.

## 🧩 Try This

* Modify `covid_data.csv` with real data
* Change population size `N`
* Try different fitting intervals (e.g., before and after intervention)
* Add vaccination or policy effect terms
